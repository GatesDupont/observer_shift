# Analysis of Project FeederWatch data demonstrating observer shift


## Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to present the code for demonstrating the observer shift in the Project FeederWatch dataset. 

## Directions
The actual analysis is conducted entirely in script 05. That script (05) loads an SQLite database file, which must be downloaded from Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/10215261). You can recreate the observer shift figure by simply downloading the database file from Zenodo and running script 05.  

## Additional notes
Scripts 01-04 have the sole purpose of creating that SQLite databse file from publicly available data. That publicly available data is accessible at the Project FeederWatch website (https://feederwatch.org/explore/raw-dataset-requests/).
